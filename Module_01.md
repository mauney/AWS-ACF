# Cloud Concepts Overview

## Introduction to Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is using offsite hardware via the internet.

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage,  and applications via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

### Cloud Service Models
IaaS infrastructure as a service
 - Most control of the three models
 - Closest to managing your own hardware

PaaS platform as a service
 - Removes the need to manage underlying infrastructure (hardware and operating system)

SaaS software as a service
 - Complete product that is run and managed by the service provider
 - Usually refers to end-user applications, where one needs to think only about how to use a particular piece of software
 - e.g. web-based email system

 ### Cloud Deployment Models
 Cloud
  - All parts of the application will be running in the cloud

 Hybrid
  - Connect existing infrastructure and applications to cloud-based resources

 On-premises (private cloud)

## Advantages of Cloud Computing
1. Trade capital expenses for variable expenses
2. Economies of scale
3. Stop guessing capacity
4. Increase speed and agility
5. Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
6. Go global in minutes

## Introduction to Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Three major ways to access and create the ecosystem
 - AWS Management Console: web browser graphical interface
 - Command Line Interace: access to services by discrete commands or scripts
 - Software Development Kits: access sercives directly from your code

## AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)
 - The AWS CAF organizes guidance into six areas of focus, called perspectives.
 - Perspectives consist of sets of business or technology capabilities that are the responsibility of key stakeholders.
