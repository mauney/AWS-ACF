# Cloud Economics and Billing

## Fundamentals of Pricing
Three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS
 - Compute, per unit of time (per hour or, for Linux, per second)
 - Storage, usually per GB
 - Data Transfer, usually per GB (outbound only, with exceptions)

Data transfer between services in the same region is free

## Total Cost of Ownership

In general, it is difficult to comapre a physical implementation with the AWS Cloud. The two are different because they use different concepts and terms. So how can you identify the best options? You can identify the best option by comparing the physical solution to the cloud solution.
